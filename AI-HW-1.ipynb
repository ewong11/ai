    "All right... We'd like to create a list and set of **n** unique integers each (as above), that takes a certain amount of time to produce.  In other words, suppose we chose a time of 0.5 seconds: now how large should **n** be such that it takes about 0.5 seconds for _RandListSet(n)_ to run?  This, of course, is dependent upon many things: principally, the speed of your computer, but also the version of Python you're using, the particular algorithm inside _RandListSet()_, your shoe size, etc. Therefore, you can't just try _TimeIt(n)_ over and over, by hand, until you're in the ballpark of the chosen execution time.\n",

Here's an example: _FindN(2.0,0.1)_ means finding **n** so that _RandListSet(n)_ takes about 2 seconds plus-or-minus 10% -- in other words, between 1.8 and 2.2 seconds.\n",
